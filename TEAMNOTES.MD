# Team Notes

## Event Badge Requirements:
- Work for any conference that would have an image
- Needs to implement a variable for where it says MEDIA, as well as name, title, and company and personal image
- Needs to emulate this visually. The graphics are included in the comp (view source as to how to emulate/copy)
- Element must be wired to HAX
- Demo must have 4 example badges, one for each of the member of our team
- Have multiple elements or properties for things like the top bar that has media on it, the TV screen, and the footer image.
- Have a property to do a CSS transformation to make this sepia, black & white, or normal looking (retro-card has some examples)
- A meaningful automated test for the element you produce
- A story that allows for leveraging properties
- Teamnotes maintained with status updates
- Published to NPM

Bonus:
- Optional support for an icon to render in HAX (+1%)
- Add lazyloading support for all assets and the element itself (+1%)
- More to be announced as we move forward

## Status Check-Ins:

### Check-in 1
What project/issue you picked(link to it):
- Event Badge: https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/607

Hand-drawn Sketch:
- [Check-In1Sketch.pdf](https://github.com/runtimeErrorsMadeEasy/Project3/blob/master/Check-In1Sketch.pdf)

Initial questions/unknowns:
- How do we wire our element to Hax?
- Can we take creative liberties with the design of our event badges that aren't a part of the comp?

What elements do you expect are needed for this design?
- Badge Header
- Badge Footer
- Image
- Badge

What properties do you expect these to have?
- CSS Styling
- Padding
- Color Variations
- Icon Changablily 
- Changing of the individuals information

Slots?
- I believe we will definitely need to use slots to make the different parts of the project work currently as they will need to be flexible.

What CSS/Styling unknowns are there presently?
- We don't know yet but will probably come up with some as the project progresses.

What states does it have? can you click/hover to engage with it?
- We could possibly have hover states that change the look of the badge, but we will decide this for 100% later on in the project.

What properties need to be mapped to HAX/the storybook? What can the user interact with?
- The user with need to be able to change the badge holder information, image, as well as the different color variations for the different elements within the badge.
